High Fidelity's Marketplace is the beginning of a complete object registration, ownership and distribution system.

It works in tandem with our Commerce feature allowing users to buy and sell certified copies of items in High Fidelity. 

For further help, please contact the Marketplace staff at marketplace@highfidelity.com.
