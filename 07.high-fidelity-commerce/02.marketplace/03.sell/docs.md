*Learn how to upload items (to sell) to the Marketplace*

## Overview

Learn how you can upload your items to the Marketplace and be made available for purchase to all users in High Fidelity. 



## Introduction

If you've created a 3D Model or written a script, you can make it available for other users to download. 

Let's go through the process of uploading an item to Marketplace!

We're going to upload a model of a water fountain. This process covers three major steps:

- Starting the process of adding the item in Marketplace. 
- Using Interface to get the .JSON file.
- Uploading to Marketplace. 



### Adding an Item to Marketplace

- Go to High Fidelity's [Marketplace](https://highfidelity.com/marketplace) on the web. 

- Log in with your credentials if you haven't. 

- The page displays different items available in Marketplace and the various categories they fall under. ![](scr1.PNG)

- Click on the "+ New Item" button below the categories. ![](scr2.PNG)

- The page that opens contains details of your item that you can start filling in. Don't upload your model's .fbx file yet. ![](scr3.PNG) 

- You can add the name of your model, it's description and image. Enter the price you want to sell your model at (in HFC).

- Quantity<a id="editions"></a>: The quantity here determines how many copies of your item can be sold. If you leave it as its default value of "-1", you are allowing an unlimited number of your items to be available for purchase. You can also choose *Item is a limited edition* to ensure that only a specific number of copies of your item are available for purchase. If you enter a number, say 25, you are saying that only 25 copies of your item will be available for purchase.
