A High Fidelity domain can have an environment to express a theme. Environments include all the domain content, such as entities, skyboxes, assets, and more. You could have a domain with a deserted island environment or a cyberpunk apartment environment. 

[Environments are available for purchase on our Marketplace](../../explore/bank-and-shop). If you don't want to use any of the available environments, you can create your own. 

## Create an Environment

An environment consists different types of 3D models and a skybox following the theme of your choice. You can create an environment using:

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
|  Marketplace Items      |    You can [purchase various models](../../explore/bank-and-shop) like buildings and skyboxes from the Marketplace. For example, you can change the skybox in your domain by purchasing a different one from the Marketplace.          |
| 3D Models Available | You can purchase or get [3D models from online 3D content websites](../3d-models/get-model). Then, you can [import these models using the Asset Server](../3d-models/import-model#import-3d-models-using-the-asset-server). |
| Your 3D Models | You can use 3D modeling software like Blender or Maya to create your own 3D models and [import them into your High Fidelity domain](../3d-models/import-model#import-3d-models-using-the-asset-server). |
| A Content Archive File | High Fidelity domain settings have downloadable content archives. These archives are zip files containing all domain content information. You can [use a backup file of your own or one sent to you by a user](../../host/backup-restore-domain#restore-your-domain). |
